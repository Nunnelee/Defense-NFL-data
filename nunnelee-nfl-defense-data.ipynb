We'll employ player tracking data for all drop-back pass plays from the 2018 regular season. The goal of submissions is to identify unique and impactful approaches to measure defensive performance on these plays. There are several different directions for participants to utilize —which may require levels of football savvy, data aptitude, and creativity. As examples:\n\n* What are coverage schemes (man, zone, etc) that the defense employs? What coverage options tend to be better performing?\n* Which players are the best at closely tracking receivers as they try to get open?\n* Which players are the best at closing on receivers when the ball is in the air?\n* Which players are the best at defending pass plays when the ball arrives?\n* Is there any way to use player tracking data to predict whether or not certain penalties – for example, defensive pass interference – will be called?\n* Who are the NFL’s best players against the pass?\n* How does a defense react to certain types of offensive plays?\n* Is there anything about a player – for example, their height, weight, experience, speed, or position – that can be used to predict their performance on defense?\n* What does data tell us about defending the pass play?\n\n# Evaulation\nThe challenge is to generate actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data that corresponds to defensive backs. Suggestions made here represent some of the approaches that football coaches are currently thinking of, but there undoubtedly several others.\n\nAn entry to the competition consists of a Notebook submission that is evaluated on the following five components, where 0 is the low score and 10 is the high score.\n\nNote: All notebooks submitted must be made public on or before the submission deadline to be eligible.\n\nOpen Competition: The first aim takes on what an NFL defense does once a quarterback drops back to pass. This includes coverage schemes (typically man versus zone), how players (often termed “secondary” defenders) disrupt and prevent the offense from completing passes, and how, once the ball is in the air, the defense works to ensure that a pass falls incomplete.\n\n## Big Data Bowl 2021 scoring sheet\nSubmissions will be judged by the NFL based on how well they address:\n\nInnovation:\n\nAre the proposed findings actionable?\nIs this a way of looking at tracking data that is novel?\nIs this project creative?\nAccuracy:\n\nIs the work correct?\nAre claims backed up by data?\nAre the statistical models appropriate given the data?\nRelevance:\n\nWould NFL teams (or the league office) be able to use these results on a week-to-week basis?\nDoes the analysis account for variables that make football data complex?\nClarity:\n\nEvaluate the writing with respect to how clear the writer(s) make findings.\nData visualization/tables:\n\nAre the charts and tables provided accessible, interesting, visually appealing, and accurate?\n\nNotebooks should consist of no more than 2,000 words and no more than 7 tables/figures. Submissions will not be penalized for any number of words or figures under this limit. Participants are encouraged to show statistical code if it helps readers better understand their analyses; most, if not all code, however, should be hidden in the Appendix."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparing the tools\nWe're going to use Matplotlib, as well as Numpy and Pandas"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import all the tools we need\n\n# Regular EDA (exploratory data analysis) and plotting libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# we want our plots to appear inside the notebook\n%matplotlib inline \n\n# Models from Scikit-Learn\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# Model Evaluations\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load the data\nThere is a lot of data bases.
